# Intro
I am a tech enthusiast. I believe in human's potential in the era of AI.

My vision is to bring inspirations to all, and to encourage innovations and creativities. Hope not to be just part in the Industrial Revolution, but also the Renassiance of Humanity.

# ADHD & My vision in AI
Grew up with ADHD but only been diagnosed until my mid-20s. I am a history graduate, and been working as an assistant to executives in my career. I was working so hard to overcome the impact brought by ADHD to my daily life and work and I was once direction-less, burn-out and frustrated, thinking there is very little chance I could find my path and passion. Until I come up with the concept of AI/automate.
<br>
<br>
But what truly motivated me was visionary future I saw when I am doing 1-on-1 communications with my team members. We were impressed and enjoyed from what "WE could do", but not just what "AI could do".
<br>
<br>
I believe in the light of AI development, we should not be just focusing on how it could change operations from top-down, but also from bottom-up and focus more on individuals' humanistic and artistic development.
<br>
<br>
Many would agree we are heading towards the 4th industrial revolution. This time the factor of human touch is more important than ever. And everyone should have their own exploration journey.
