# Intro
I am a tech enthusiast, but I believe that humans are the most important factor as we enter the AI era. My goal is to inspire others. I find fulfillment in seeing people unlock their potential and take innovation and creativity to the next level.

# My vision
I grew up with ADHD but was only diagnosed in my mid-20s. As a history graduate working as an executive assistant, I struggled to overcome the challenges that ADHD brought to my daily life and work. At times, I felt directionless, burned out, and frustrated, doubting whether I would ever find my path and passion. That changed when I discovered the concept of AI and automation.
<br>
<br>
What truly motivated me, however, was the visionary future I glimpsed during one-on-one communications with my team members. We were not just impressed by what 'AI could do,' but inspired by what 'we could do' together.
<br>
<br>
I believe that as AI development progresses, we should not only focus on how it can change operations from the top down but also consider its impact from the bottom up, emphasizing the importance of humanistic and artistic development.
<br>
<br>
As we move towards, what lays ahead is not only the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but also the Renaissance that belongs to our generation.
